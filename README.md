### A basic modified VRChat SDK with download links to a variety of plugins, avatars and shaders for free. 
In the future it will feature more avatars, shaders and plugins.

The result of young developers with too much time on their hands and little to no money to buy models and shaders with.

We are a small, open source SDK ran by developers you can trust. We aren't owned by a sketchy group or anything like a gang.
Feel free to look through our unobfuscated source code.
