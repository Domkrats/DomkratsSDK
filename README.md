### A basic modified VRChat SDK with download links to a variety of plugins and shaders for free. 
In the future it will feature a variety of totally legally obtained furry models as well as more general features.

The result of young developers with too much time on their hands and little to no money to buy models and shaders with.
The main reason I wanted to found this is that avatar/shader creators are making their costs way too high and Domkrats SDK is here to rectify that.

We are a small, open source SDK ran by developers you can trust. We aren't owned by a sketchy group or anything like a gang.
Feel free to look through our unobfuscated source code.
